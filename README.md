(you were the chosen one...)
___

If you are like me, back in the days we only had a Browser, it happens to be the internet Explorer for Mac. Unfortunatelly those days are over, first we got the Mozilla Navigator, than Opera, firefox, Safari, chrome and so on...

Actually I use diferrent Browsers for diferrents purpose. e.g.:
	
  1. Chrome is just my Flash Bootloader
  2. Firefox great for Web development
  3. Safari is my current default Browser
  4. Sleipnir rocks my iOS devices and has a great syncs capabilities with the Mac.
  
Now you're using your favorite Twitter client and you want to open a Link, it includes a cat flash video... how do you deal with it? HINT: _Anakin, you were the chosen one..._

All you need is to set Anakin as your default Browser, everything else Anakin will solve for you.

Get it before Anakin turn to dark side.
